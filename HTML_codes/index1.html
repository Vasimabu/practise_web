        <h1>Cricket - health benefits</h1>
        <p>Cricket can be played for competition or for fun.Cricket is a good sport for developing overall fitness, stamina and hand-eye coordination.
            Cricket uses a hard ball, so protective gear should be worn to avoid injury.</p>
        <p>Although there is some standing around, to play cricket you need to be fit and strong, and have good hand-eye coordination and ball-handling skills. 
            Cricket involves sprinting between wickets and running to stop balls, as well as bowling and throwing.</p>
        <p>If you want to start playing competitive cricket, youâ€™ll need to join a club. This will often mean you will have to pay club membership and competition fees. 
            For competitions, you will also need to buy pants and shirts to play in (cricket whites) and cricket spikes (shoes with spikes) for playing on the turf.</p>
